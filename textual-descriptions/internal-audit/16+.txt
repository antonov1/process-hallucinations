First, **the audit coordinator sends a notification to the regional office**. Then, **the regional office prepares financial statements** and **the regional office gathers necessary documents**. At the same time, **the compliance team checks regulatory updates that might affect the audit**. Next, **the regional office submits the documents to the central audit team**. After submission, **the central audit team reviews the submission**. If discrepancies are identified, **the audit team requests clarifications of discrepancies**, and then **the regional office provides the necessary clarifications**. Once all issues are resolved, **the audit team completes risk assessment and mitigation**. This includes, in any order, **evaluating financial risks**, **evaluating operational risks**, and **evaluating compliance risks**. If significant risk is identified, **a detailed investigation is launched**, which may include **conducting data analysis**, **conducting interviews**, and **performing site visits**. After the risk-related activities are completed, **the audit team compiles the audit report**. Then, **the report is reviewed by the audit director**. Either, **the audit director may approve the report** or **the audit director may send the report for revision**. If revisions are needed, **the audit team updates and resubmits the report**, after which **the report is reviewed by the audit director** again. Once the report is approved, **the final report is distributed to the executive board**, **the report is archived**, and finally, **the audit process is closed**.
