First, the audit is closed, the report is archived, the final report is distributed, and the report is reported. Then, the report is reviewed by audit director. However, sometimes, changes are required. In that case, the report is updated and resubmitted and the report is sent for revision. The audit report is compiled, the risk assessment and mitigation is completed. Then, at the same time, interviews are conducted, data analysis is conducted, and optionally a site visit is performed. Afterwards, the detailed investigation is launched. Nevertheless, the last four steps, i.e., conducting data analysis, interviews, site visits, and launching a detailed investigation might be skipped altogether. After that, simultaneously, the financial risks, the compliance risks, and the operational risks are evaluated. Optionally, clarifications are received. If clarifications are received, then the audit team requests clarifications of discovered discrepancies. Then, the review is submitted, and, in the end, the documents are submitted.
